          <h1>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h1>

<p>SDLC is a series of phases that provide a common understandings of the software building process. SDLC models as tools that you can use to better deliver your software project.</p>

<p>Basic stages of Software Development Life Cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Planning and Requirement Analysis</p>
<ul>
<li>Each software development life cycle model starts with the analysis, in which the stakeholders of the process discuss the requirements for the final product. The goal of this stage is the detailed definition of the system requirements. Besides, it is needed to make sure that all the process participants have clearly understood the tasks and how every requirement is going to be implemented.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designing Project Architecture</p>
<ul>
<li>At the second phase of the software development life cycle, the developers are actually designing the architecture. All the different technical questions that may appear on this stage are discussed by all the stakeholders, including the customer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Development and Programming</p>
<ul>
<li>After the requirements approved, the process goes to the next stage – actual development. Programmers start here with the source code writing while keeping in mind previously defined requirements. The system administrators adjust the software environment, front-end programmers develop the user interface of the program and the logics for its interaction with the server.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing</p>
<ul>
<li>The testing phase includes the debugging process. All the code flaws missed during the development are detected here, documented, and passed back to the developers to fix. The testing process repeats until all the critical issues are removed and software workflow is stable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deployment</p>
<ul>
<li>When the program is finalized and has no critical issues – it is time to launch it for the end users. After the new program version release, the tech support team joins. This department provides user feedback; consult and support users during the time of exploitation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no specific prerequisites for this SDLC tutorial and any software professional can go through this tutorial to get a bigger picture of how the high-quality software applications and products are designed. A good understanding of programming or testing or project management will give you an added advantage.</p>

<p>SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations. The system development should be complete in the pre-defined time frame and cost. SDLC consists of a detailed plan which explains how to plan, build, and maintain specific software.<br>
Here, are prime reasons why SDLC is important for developing a software system.<br>
•	It offers a basis for project planning, scheduling, and estimating<br>
•	Provides a framework for a standard set of activities and deliverables<br>
•	It is a mechanism for project tracking and control<br>
•	Increases visibility of project planning to all involved stakeholders of the development process<br>
•	Increased and enhance development speed<br>
•	Improved client relations<br>
•	Helps you to decrease project risk and project management plan overhead</p>

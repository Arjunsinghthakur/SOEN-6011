Software configuration control deals with the management of changes in various phases of software development. By using a **disciplined approach to change management**, new changes can be incorporated into the software product. This is crucial in software development because the requirements can change at any point of the development process. This skill falls in line with Agile approach to software development as requirements change often.

Changes are needed even after the software is delivered to the client, for example a client might need to incorporate a new payment system to their existing web application. Or a client might want to improve their response time of their existing site. Thereby also playing a part in maintenance activities too


Having a change management tool helps the software development process by
* Tracking who made the changes
* Tracking where the change happened
* Tracking what each change does
* Providing a way to identify what changes are needed
* Providing a way to review and authorise changes
* Providing a way to propose new changes
* Making collaboration within the team easier
* Providing a way to manage build pipeline
* Providing a way to manage version control


## Classification of Skill
---
Software configuration control for most part is a **technical** skill, as it includes some aspect of project management. Although project management seems like it would be a soft skill, In reality it does require a lot of technical expertise to plan, delegate , engineer a software project.

## Prerequisites for Skill
---
* Exposure to change management tools like Ansible, Chef, Jenkins, Jira
* Knowledge of version control systems like Git

## Related Software Engineering Area(s)

### DevOps
bridges the gap between development and operations, which helps in building,testing,deployment of an application at a faster pace
### Software Quality Assurance
Application must be tested continuosly throughout the development process, Having traceability ensures that the agreed upon software quality assurances are met
### Project Management
Includes management activities such as planning, managing resources, time, developers to deliver a software product to the customers,clients or stakeholders
## Rationale for Skill
* Having traceability built into your software development pipeline, benefits not only in development but also in project management and quality assurance.
* Without a system for change management, there is no way of knowing what components of the system would be affected by a new change.
* Version Control System for the source code, helps in managing different versions of the software over the course of the development
* VCS would also help teams to work independently from each other, but at the same time allow them to collaborate together to develop one final merged common version.
* As a VCS would track changes of the entire project over time, the developers have the freedom to experiment with the source code and revert back to an earlier version if needed without any problems.
* By having a change control board, the changes can be approved or rejected, as not all changes can be pursued with the constraints like budget, time, expertise, effort.

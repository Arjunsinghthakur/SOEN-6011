## Name of Skill
---
Eliciting software requirements

## Classification of Skill
---
* Software requirements specifications

## Prerequisites for Skill
---
* Complete understanding of the problem domain
* Identifying stake holders 
* Communication skills and observation skills.

## Related Software Engineering Area(s)
---
* It is closely related to Software design,testing,maintenance,Software configuration management,sofware engineering models and methods
as constant feedback from the stakeholders might be necessary and the development team has to conform to requirements at every stage.

## Rationale for Skill
---
* It is an important process in SDLC where the requirements are gathered followed by analysis phase.
* it requires discovering and researching about the requirements because the complete knowledge of requirements
* can not be gathrered by simply communicating with stakeholders and customers. Common practices for elicitation are interviews, questionaire,
* identifying the audience, identifying technical constraints, etc.

## Roles for Skill
---
* To gather the requirements by researching requirements for poroject/system from the end users and stakeholders and also analyzing changes to the requirements.

## Work Related to Skill (Related Activities and Artifacts)
---
* Obtaining requirements information by conducting interviews of stakeholders
* Conducting interviews
* Prototyping to get regular feedbacks from customers 
* Meetings with stakeholders/customers
* Reading available documentations


## Real-World Example/Scenario of Skill (Text, Graphic, Audio, Video)
---
* The following are the questions which can be asked to the stakeholders as:

* What does success look like to you and your team ?
* What are the problems you think we should try to solve ?
* What is the ideal outcome you want from this project ?
* Who else you think we should talk to ?
* Any important factors you want us to focus on ?


## Role of Academia or Industry in Cultivating the Skill
---
* There is an immense documentation for eliciting software requirements being taught to software engineering students and also available on the internet easily.
Since, eliciting software requirements is an important and the most error prone phase, the documentations availabel teaches us to properly conduct the methods
for elicitation of software requirements.


## Tools Supporting the Skill
---
* Use case diagrams-represents the interaction between users and software artifacts.

* Sequence diagrams- This represents the flow of scope between objects in the system.

* Jama software- it provides a platform for requirements,risk and test management.

* Google docs- this tool can be used as questionnaire form of interview and thus the answers can be filled by the stakeholders and users.

* Skype- This can be used to conduct online interviews.



## Skill Self-Assessment
---
* 9/10 
* Reason: Elicitation is about knowing what really end users, stakeholders require.Any deviation from their requirements and needs
will leaad to failure of the purpose and the system.Therefore, Eliciting software requirements is an important phase in software development.

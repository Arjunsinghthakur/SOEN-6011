<p>Software Quality Assurance</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a class="direct-link" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>Software Quality Assurance(SQA) is a set of activities for ensuring quality in software engineering processes that ultimately results, or at least gives confidence, in the quality of software products.<br>
Software quality may refer to desirable characteristics of software products, to the extent to which a particular software product possess those characteristics, and to processes, tools, and techniques used to achieve those characteristics. It is a part of quality management focused on providing confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="classification-of-skill">Classification of Skill <a class="direct-link" href="#classification-of-skill">#</a></h2>
<hr>
<p>Software Quality Assurance is an umbrella activity which is employed throughout the software lifecycle.<br>
Software quality assurance is very important <strong>TECHNICAL SKILL</strong> for every software product or service to succeed in the market and survive up to the customer’s expectations.</p>
<p>SQA has two aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Product Assurance</p>
<p>SQA product assurance activities make certain to provide evidence that software products and related documentation are identified in and comply with contracts; and ensure that nonconformances are identified and addressed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process Assurance</p>
<p>SQA process assurance activities make certain that the processes used to develop, install, operate, and maintain software conform to contracts, comply with any imposed laws, rules, and regulations and are adequate, efficient and effective for their intended purpose</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="software-configuration-management">Software Configuration Management <a class="direct-link" href="#software-configuration-management">#</a></h3>
<p>Software configuration management (SCM) is a set of processes, policies, and tools that organizes the development process. It simultaneously maintains the current state of the software, while enabling developers to work on new versions for features or fixes.</p>
<h3 id="software-testing">Software Testing <a class="direct-link" href="#software-testing">#</a></h3>
<p>Software Testing is an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software system is Defect free. It can also provide an objective, independent view of the software to allow the business to appreciate and understand the risks of software implementation.</p>
<h3 id="software-maintanence">Software Maintanence <a class="direct-link" href="#software-maintanence">#</a></h3>
<p>Software maintenance is a part of Software Development Life Cycle. Its main purpose is to modify and update software application after delivery to correct faults and to improve performance. It stands for all the modifications and updations done after the delivery of software product.</p>

<p>SQA testing is essential for each development phase of a software product until its final release. Without SQA, the software development process would be continued until the end, ignoring the errors that may have appeared in one of these phases. With the help of a QA engineer, this problem does not occur, and errors are corrected on time. It ensures that a software product was developed in a high-quality manner. The practices present in SQA can be implemented in almost all types of software development, not taking into account the model which is used for it.</p>
<h3 id="the-quality-of-the-product-is-checked">The quality of the product is checked <a class="direct-link" href="#the-quality-of-the-product-is-checked">#</a></h3>
<p>Quality assurance testing is highly necessary to ensure that the product meets the standards and it is fully operational, no bugs, glitches or errors included. If these are found in an earlier process, they can be fixed on time and the risk of failure is reduced tremendously.</p>
<h3 id="saving-money-and-time">Saving money and time <a class="direct-link" href="#saving-money-and-time">#</a></h3>
<p>When fixing bugs in an early stage of the process, additional expenses and a lot of wasted hours are saved. A fully failed software will cost the team a lot more to fix and it might require starting from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="improving-the-ux">Improving the UX <a class="direct-link" href="#improving-the-ux">#</a></h3>
<p>The User Experience is a critical factor when developing software applications. UX issues must be fixed earlier in the process so that users don’t get to experience them with the final product. An SQA engineer makes sure that such issue is never encountered, and using the software app is easy and intuitive.</p>
<h3 id="improving-customer-satisfaction">Improving customer satisfaction <a class="direct-link" href="#improving-customer-satisfaction">#</a></h3>
<p>The same goes for customer satisfaction. A software QA engineer will make sure that the user is happy with the final product. If the user finds the product reliable and easy to use, it was a success.</p>
<h3 id="organizing-the-activities-better">Organizing the activities better <a class="direct-link" href="#organizing-the-activities-better">#</a></h3>
<p>Software quality assurance makes sure that the whole software development process is well-organized. All phases and activities are tested after they are finished, which leaves room for improvements and fixes. Thus, the QA engineers keep the activity efficient and hierarchic.</p>

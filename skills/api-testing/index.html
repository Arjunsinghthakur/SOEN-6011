It is a part of integration testing and performed without GUI.<br>
API testing commonly includes testing REST APIs or SOAP web services with JSON or XML message payloads being sent over HTTP, HTTPS.</p>

API testing itself involves the following practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unit testing - Testing the functionality of individual operations.</li>
<li>Functional testing - Testing the functionality of broader scenarios, often using unit tests as building blocks for end-to-end tests.</li>
<li>Load testing - Validating functionality and performance under load, often by reusing functional test cases.</li>
<li>Security testing - Includes penetration testing and fuzz testing as well as validating authentication, encryption, and access control.</li>
<li>Web UI testing - Performed as part of end-to-end integration tests that also cover APIs, enables teams to validate GUI items in the context of the larger transaction.</li>
<li>Security testing - This testing includes what type of authentication is required and whether sensitive data is encrypted over HTTP or both</li>

<p>Tester should have knowleddge of :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Difference between API testing and Unit Testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Types of Bugs that API testing detects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fails to handle error conditions gracefully</li>
<li>Unused flags</li>
<li>Missing or duplicate functionality</li>
<li>Reliability Issues. Difficulty in connecting and getting a response from API.</li>
<li>Security Issues</li>
<li>Multi-threading issues</li>
<li>Performance Issues. API response time is very high.</li>
<li>Improper errors/warning to a caller</li>
<li>Incorrect handling of valid argument values</li>
<li>Response Data is not structured correctly (JSON or XML)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Difference between REST and SOAP web services.</p>
<ul>
<li>SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol whereas REST stands for Representational State Transfer.</li>
<li>SOAP is a protocol whereas REST is an architectural pattern.</li>
<li>SOAP uses service interfaces to expose its functionality to client applications while REST uses Uniform Service locators to access to the components on the hardware device.</li>
<li>SOAP needs more bandwidth for its usage whereas REST doesn’t need much bandwidth.</li>
<li>SOAP only works with XML formats whereas REST work with plain text, XML, HTML and JSON.</li>
<li>SOAP cannot make use of REST whereas REST can make use of SOAP.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When to use REST and when to use SOAP.</p>
<p>REST services should be used in the following instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statelessness – Statelessness means that every HTTP request happens in complete isolation. When the client makes an HTTP request, it includes all information necessary for the server to fulfill that request. The server never relies on information from previous requests. If that information was important, the client would have sent it again in this request.</li>
<li>Caching – If there is a need to cache a lot of requests then REST is the perfect solution. At times, clients could request for the same resource multiple times. This can increase the number of requests which are sent to the server. By implementing a cache, the most frequent queries results can be stored in an intermediate location. So whenever the client requests for a resource, it will first check the cache. If the resources exist then, it will not proceed to the server. So caching can help in minimizing the amount of trips which are made to the web server.</li>
</ul>
<p>SOAP services should be used in the following instances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stateful Operations - When the application has a requirement that state needs to be maintained from one request to another, use SOAP. We can take the example of any online purchasing site. These sites normally need the user first to add items which need to be purchased to a cart. All of the cart items are then transferred to the payment page in order to complete the purchase. This is an example of an application which needs the state feature. The state of the cart items needs to be transferred to the payment page for further processing.</li>
<li>Asynchronous processing and subsequent invocation – if there is a requirement that the client needs a guaranteed level of reliability and security then the new SOAP standard of SOAP 1.2 provides a lot of additional features, especially when it comes to security.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Unit Testing<br>
APIs is testing a single endpoint, with a single request, looking for a single response or set of responses.</li>
<li>Integration Testing<br>
Integration testing is the most often used form of API testing, as APIs are at the center of most integrations between internal or third-party services.</li>
<li>End-to-End Testing<br>
End-to-End testing can help us validate the flow of data and information between a few different API connections.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rationale-for-skill">Rationale for Skill <a class="direct-link" href="#rationale-for-skill">#</a></h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>API testing allows the tester to find bugs earlier in the development process, often before the UI has been created. API testing allows the tester to make requests that might not be allowed through the UI, which is crucial for exposing potential security flaws in an application.</li>
<li>Most of the companies are using Microservices nowadays and most microservices are using application programming interfaces (APIs), which are a set of commands for how a service can be used.</li>

<ul>
<li>To run API request there is a need to first select the Method Type and paste URL of the API. Press Send button to send the request to API or press Add API Test button to save the request.</li>
<li>Method Type could be GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
<ul>
<li>A GET request fetches a record from a database</li>
<li>A POST request adds a new record to a database</li>
<li>A PUT request replaces a record with a new one</li>
<li>A PATCH request replaces part of a record with new information</li>
<li>A DELETE request removes a record from a database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>API require additional inputs to perform the request such as parameters, Headers, Body (JSON), and so on.</li>
<li>HTTP headers that provide information to the server about the request such as:
<ul>
<li>The Host: the domain and port number of the user making the request</li>
<li>Authorization: the credentials of the user making the request</li>
<li>The Content-Type: the format of the information provided in the body of the request</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A request body that provides further details for the request (this can sometimes be empty).</li>
<li>In case your hosted API needs authentication, you can go to the Authorization tab and select the BasicAuth from the dropdown list (Default it is set as Noauth) and then input the Username and Password. You are now ready to send authenticated requests.</li>
<li>In the automation process, it is important that you verify your output using an assertion. To add an assertion in the API Runner, go to the Assertions tab. You can add one or more assertions there.
<ul>
<li>Follow these steps to add assertions:</li>
<li>Choose the response type</li>
<li>Choose the assertion’s condition</li>
<li>Input the value to be checked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Variables tab is useful to store the values that are received as a response from an API request sent. To save responses go to the Variables tab and follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>Add Variable</li>
<li>Give a name to the variable for better understanding of the team</li>
<li>Input the JSON Path of the value to be stored from the response body</li>
<li>To use the stored value in the variable as expected assertion you can use name of the variable in any other API request.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Response codes are three-digit codes used to describe the result of the REST request. The response body will vary by what type of request was made. The most common response codes come in one of these three categories:
<ul>
<li>200-level responses indicate that the request was received, understood, and processed</li>
<li>400-level responses indicate that the request was received, but that there was an error from the client</li>
<li>500-level responses indicate that there was some sort of server error</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Download Postman tool or any other tool you want to use.</li>
<li>Click on New and give a name to your request, prefer to give pupose of request as a name.</li>
<li>Select folder where you want to store all your requests, create one if there is no pre-declared workspace.</li>
<li>Choose action from dropdown, and than add URL of your API.</li>
<li>Headers, Authorization, Parameters are optional.</li>
<li>Click on Send and you will see result in Body.<br>

<p>Industry has major role to play in success of API and its testing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deloitte:</strong> Companies are architecting and designing their technology as discrete sets of digital building blocks intended to be reused. The “API imperative” involves strategically deploying services and platforms for use both within and beyond the enterprise.<br>
(<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends/2018/api-program-strategy.html">https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/focus/tech-trends/2018/api-program-strategy.html</a>).</li>
<li>The global API testing market size is expected to grow from USD 384.3 Million in 2016 to USD 1,099.1 Million by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 19.69% from 2017 to 2022. The base year considered for the study is 2016 and the forecast period is 2017–2022.</li>
<li>North America is expected to hold the largest market share in the API testing market during the forecast period, as APIs enable businesses across industries to monetize their services by exposing their APIs to the external world. North America is at the forefront in the adoption of such APIs that enable businesses to create value by offering their APIs.</li>
<li>Applications of financial institutions give the right people access to the data they need, while protecting that data from the wrong people. As applications have become necessary to the way we do business today, APIs (application programming interfaces) have become indispensable. APIs are the tools that allow companies that provide financial services to do all these things — they enable connectivity, while inspiring innovative developers to create new products, improve existing services, and work more efficiently.</li>
